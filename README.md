## Work-In-Progress

- ref: https://processwire.com/blog/posts/pw-3.0.179/

## Requirement

- Module **Less** (https://processwire.com/modules/less/)

## Howto

There is two ways to use it. For both ways, install the module [LESS](https://processwire.com/modules/less/)

1) Using the `LESS` file (recommended)

- Clone or download the repo, and copy the file `admin.less` in `/site/templates` then refresh the page.

2) Using the compiled `CSS` file

- Download the `CSS` file from the repo's releases and copy the file `admin.css` in the `/site/assets` path then refresh the page.
